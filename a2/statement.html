<br><br>2.	Column A: Our piece may be considered to be a crossover between an artwork and a game, but it leans more as a game. This game is similar to visual novels and role playing games where the user plays the main character. There are certain levels where the user may not be able to pass if they do not solve certain riddles.
<br><br>Column B: <br>

Column C:<br>
Bogost - Ian Bogost's chapter, "The Rhetoric of Video Games" (w6-7)<br>
Like all cultural artifacts, no video game is produced in a cultural vacuum. All bear the biases of their creators. Video games can help shed light on these ideological biases.
<br>Other games strive to explain and support a particular method for accomplishing a political or social goal; these games use procedural rhetoric to make an argument, and players unpack that argument.
<br>Anthropy - excerpts from Anna Anthropy's book, Rise of the Videogame Zinesters (w7-8)
<br>“Games tell stories that communicate the values of their creators in a unique way: not just through their explicit content but through the logic of their design, and the systems they choose to model.“
<br>“Not every game needs a title screen, but a title screen is very good at giving the player a contest with which to understand the experience that follows. Think about what the first thing the player sees tells her about the game she's about to play.” 
<br>“The way your game ends is the last thing the player will see, and will similarly have a great effect on how she interprets the experience as a whole. “
<br><br>Column D:
<br>As a group of three, we decided that the JavaScript-oriented option with 8 pages integrating JS (10 pages total) is the better choice. However, it seems that we may have well exceeded that limit and reached a total of 20 pages.
<br><br>3.	The main theme of our game is cute horror. These polar opposites work in our favour as the general first impression for users will be a dark and morbid play. While that may be true, that is only half of the game play. The other half delves into cute visuals; people generally do not feel comfortable associating this with darkness. We hope to create an aesthetic that makes users feel uncomfortable but also attracts their eyes. 
<br>Our intention was to display the curiosity of a young adult. In particular, this young adult is a fourth year journalism student whose fellow journalist friend went missing. This took place after visiting their mutual friend, Brian, at Alden Stone General Hospital. The deeper the user gets into playing the game, the darker and more shocking it gets. Our project takes on the themes of power, perception, right of access of information, and unethical practices. The hospital represents our society and the hierarchy of the system. Members with higher levels of power have insurmountable control over people and information. Doctors, nurses, and surgeons have the responsibility of saving humans’ lives, providing them with the right medical diagnostics, and conducting high quality medical research. Patients are placed in a position of forced “trust” due to their health/survival being dependent on medical practitioners. In situations such as these, there is trust that the provider will not harm the patient and do everything in their strength to provide the best treatment. In society, we find stories of nurses being abusive to their patients, police shooting innocents to death, and the extension of scientists testing on animals. Powerful leaders and groups can leverage their power by concealing information from the public. 
<br>As articulated by Bogost, we have demonstrated our experiences of the current world into a simple adventure of discovering dark truths. The main character is left having discovered the dark truth and escapes, but her friends are never to be seen again. This leaves the user into thinking whether or not the main character will report her findings. The ethical dilemma of reporting her big scoop for the good of the townsfolk or for fame, or not reporting the truth for fear of her own life.
